BitVision
======
**The goal of this project is to predict daily Bitcoin price movements using machine learning algorithms.** Unlike other approaches we've seen, our feature set is comprehensive and includes technical indicators, blockchain network data (hash rate, miner's revenue, etc.), and sentiment scores of cryptocurrency-related news articles.


Three learning models are trained and evaluated: a logistic regressor, random forest classifier, and support vector classifier. Experimental results suggest a 50-60% accuracy in predicting the sign of next-day price change.
