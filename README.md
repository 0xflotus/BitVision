**BitVision is a proof-of-concept that uses machine learning to predict daily Bitcoin price movements.** The feature set consists of technical indicators, blockchain network data, and sentiment scores of cryptocurrency-related news articles. We train and evaluate three models: a logistic regressor, random forest classifier, and support vector classifier. Each model has, so far, achieved classification accuracies of 53%, 52%, and 55%, respectively.
