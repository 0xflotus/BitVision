**BitVision is a proof-of-concept that uses machine learning to predict daily Bitcoin price movements.** The feature set consists of technical indicators, blockchain network data, and sentiment scores of cryptocurrency-related news articles. Three models are trained and evaluated: a logistic regressor, a random forest classifier, and a support vector classifier. Classification accuracies of 53%, 52%, and 55% have been achieved with each model, respectively.
